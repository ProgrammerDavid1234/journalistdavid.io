        <p><span>M</span>ateo Kovacic is expected to leave Chelsea this summer, and there are plenty of clubs trying to secure his signature.  <img src="./images/th (1).jpg" alt=""> <br> The 29-year-old midfielder has been heavily linked with an exit from Stamford Bridge lately, with his contract set to expire in 12-months.
            football.london understands that the Blues are preparing for his departure, with Bayern Munich and Manchester City said to be interested. It's believed that there's not yet been talks of an extension on his current deal in west London, meaning the Croatia international will become a free agent at the end of next season. Thomas Tuchel is said to be eager to reunite with Kovacic, who performed excellently alongside the German during their time together at Chelsea. Pep Guardiola is also understood to be a big admirer, with the Premier League champions plotting a swoop.

            Despite his unimpressive form this season, Rio Ferdinand has urged his former side to ditch their pursuit of Frenkie de Jong and signed Kovacic instead. Speaking on his YouTube channel, FIVE, the 44-year-old said: "It sounds too difficult and too complicated [to sign De Jong] – move on. I think Kovacic has got a year left. I like him… He's different to what we've got."

            City open 'concrete' talks

            According to Fabrizio Romano, positive discussions have taken place with player’s camp in the last few days over personal terms. The transfer guru added that Chelsea are open to selling Kovacic as part of their midfield revolution with talks set to continue soon.
            
            The news comes after incoming manager Mauricio Pochettino had identified Sporting CP star Manuel Ugarte as a key target this summer. The Blues are currently pursuing a £52million deal to sign the 22-year-old but have hit a stumbling block over wages - with Paris Saint-Germain rivalling the west London outfit for his signing and offering significantly higher wages.

            Guardiola chat
            
            In January, when Chelsea welcomed the Premier League champions to Stamford Bridge, Guardiola was spotted making a beeline for Kovacic upon the final whistle. The 52-year-old was said to have made a special effort to talk to the Croatia international, with City having now reportedly launched a bid to sign him.
